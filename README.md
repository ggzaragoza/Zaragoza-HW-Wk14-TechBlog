# Zaragoza-HW-Wk14-TechBlog

This repository is an exercise in using Handlebars to render pages in a CMS-style blog, using several npm packages such as 'express-session' and 'connect-session-sequelize' for user authentication, and various Express API routes to retrieve posts from a MySQL database. The application has been deployed at the Heroku site below, and files may be forked from this repository and then tested by running an npm install in your own local folder. Provided JSON files can be run to seed your databased for testing purposes.
